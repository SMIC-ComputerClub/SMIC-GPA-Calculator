# Q&As
Q: How do you use this?
A: Enter your class name (optional), select your Letter Grade and class level (Regular, Honor or AP) and simply hit the calculate button.

Q: Does the GPA shown on the application show the GPA that I will get from school, assuming I entered everything right?
A: There will be an error margin of +- 0.1, as I am still unsure how the school's system of rounding up decimal goes.
   But this will still be a good representation of what you will get, assuming you entered everything right. Be assured 
   because this program was made according to SMIC grading rule (from SMIC Student Handbook)

Q: Where's my windows version? May the curse of Bill Gates on you.
A: I'm sorry... this was written in Swift, Apple's programming language so only mac version for now...

Q: Are you planning on releasing this for other platforms as well?
A: Most likely iPhone, and also maybe windows. (With Java) Stay tuned.
